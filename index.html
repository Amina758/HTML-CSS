<h1>MY SELF</h1>
<p>"I am a passionate front-end developer with a keen interest in creating visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces.
     Recently, I completed my ICS (Intermediate of Computer Science), which further solidified my foundation in programming and technology.
      I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, constantly honing my skills to bring creative ideas to life.
       My goal is to continue developing engaging, responsive websites that offer seamless user experiences."</p>
<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
     It forms the backbone of web pages, providing the basic framework that defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other multimedia. 
     HTML works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity. </p>

<li>Element</li>
<li>Attributes</li>


    </ul>

    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages.
         It allows developers to separate the content (HTML) from its visual styling, making it easier to maintain and update.
         With CSS, you can define styles for various HTML elements,
          such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning, enabling consistent and responsive designs across different devices and screen sizes. 
          CSS also supports advanced features like animations, transitions, and grid layouts, giving developers greater control over the user experience.

<li>Responsive Design </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language primarily used to enhance the interactivity and functionality of web pages.
         As a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript enables developers to create dynamic content, 
         control multimedia, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in real-time. </p>
